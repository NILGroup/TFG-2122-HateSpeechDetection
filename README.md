# ONLINE HATE SPEECH DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

Hate speech directed towards marginalized people is a very common problem online, especially in social media such as Twitter or Reddit. Automatically detecting hate speech in such spaces can help mend the Internet and transform it into a safer environment for everybody. Hate speech detection fits into text classification, a series of tasks where text is organized into categories. This project proposes using Machine Learning algorithms to detect hate speech in online text in four languages: English, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. The data to train the models was obtained from online, publicly available datasets. Three different algorithms with varying parameters have been used in order to compare their performance. The experiments show that the best results reach an 82.51% accuracy and around an 83% F1 -score, for Italian text. Each language has different results depending on distinct factors.

Notebook available for users to try out a hate speech detector

*Note: In order to do so the repo's data should be used and imported correctly following the structure in the notebook*
